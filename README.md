Phishing Email Analysis Project
📌 Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a sample phishing email to understand how to identify whether an email is genuine or not. The email sample was obtained from Google, and several checks were performed to detect common signs of phishing.

🔍 What I Did

Collected a phishing email sample from Google

Checked the sender’s email address for spoofing

Used MXToolbox Email Header Analyzer to find issues in the email header

Identified suspicious links and buttons in the message

Looked for urgent or threatening language used to pressure the reader

Found mismatched URLs that didn’t match the claimed sender

Noted grammar and formatting errors often found in phishing emails

🎯 Purpose of the Project

The goal of this project was to practice basic phishing detection techniques using simple tools and manual inspection. By analyzing different parts of the email, I learned how attackers try to trick users and how to spot those warning signs early.

🛠 Tools Used

MXToolbox Email Header Analyzer

Email client (for viewing raw header)

Browser tools (hover link preview)

Manual content review

📘 Key Learnings

How spoofed email addresses are used in phishing

How to detect header inconsistencies like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC failures

How suspicious links and urgent messages are used to trick victims

How formatting and grammar issues can be clues to phishing

How to combine technical and visual signs to judge if an email is harmful

✔ Conclusion

After reviewing all indicators—fake sender domain, header authentication failures, suspicious links, urgent wording, mismatched URLs, and grammar issues—it was clear that the email was a phishing attempt.
