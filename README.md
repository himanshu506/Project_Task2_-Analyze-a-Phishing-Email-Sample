# Project_Task2_-Analyze-a-Phishing-Email-Sample
This project analyzes a phishing email sample taken from Google. I checked the sender’s address, reviewed the header using MXToolbox, and looked for suspicious links, urgent language, mismatched URLs, and grammar errors. It helped me understand how phishing emails are identified.
